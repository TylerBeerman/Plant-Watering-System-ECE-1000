# Plant-Watering-System-ECE-1000
Automatic plant watering system for Dr. Bhattacharya's ECE 1000 course
## Project Overview
This project's goal was to read the moisture level in the soil, and report it back to the microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico), which then runs a pump to water the plant/soil. In the end this project was a success. We managed to wire and program the project ourselves. The project materials included a Raspberry Pi Pico, a 5VDC Relay, Capactive Soil Moisture Sensor, a 3-5V Submergable Water Pump, and a Pico Breadboard.
